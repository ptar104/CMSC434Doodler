# CMSC434Doodler
A simple doodler android application for my CMSC434 class

The application has functionality to change brush size, change color, change opacity,
undo/redo strokes, clear the drawing, save the drawing, and load the drawing.

To run this project, load it into an android application project, then run it on an emulator
or load it onto a compatible android phone.

To create this project, I used the android API found at developer.android.com, and
the tutorial on saving files found here:
https://developer.android.com/training/basics/data-storage/files.html

I also referenced the doodler tutorial video by Professor Jon Froehlich.
